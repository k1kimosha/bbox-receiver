# Release Notes

## Fork history (`irlserver/srt-live-server`)

The entries below cover work done in the IRL fork on top of the upstream `rstular/srt-live-server` history (preserved further down). Versions follow the `project(... VERSION)` field in `CMakeLists.txt`. Within a version, entries are grouped by feature area rather than per commit.

### v3.1.0 (in progress)

**SRTLA / bonded cellular**

- `listen_publisher_srtla` directive (and a separate listen port) enables SRTLA patches automatically on the publisher socket. Direct SRT publishers stay on `listen_publisher` without the patches. Multiple ports per role via comma lists and inclusive ranges (`listen_player 4000,4010,5000-5005`).

**Player key authentication**

- Per stream player keys validated against an external HTTP endpoint with rate limiting, length and character validation, success and failure caching, configurable cache duration and timeouts.
- Per session `max_players_per_stream` override returned in the validation response.
- Non blocking player key validation: deferred accept lets the worker keep serving traffic while the HTTP lookup is in flight. Reject and retry path for transient validation failures.

**Push destinations from publish auth webhook**

- The publish auth webhook may return a `pushTargets` array. SLS spawns one dynamic `CSLSPusher` per accepted entry, bounded by the new app level knobs (`push_destination_max`, `push_destination_allow_internal`, `push_destination_allow_self`, `push_destination_allow_schemes`, `push_destination_max_url_len`).
- URL validation includes DNS resolution and self bind detection.

**Bitrate limiting**

- `max_input_bitrate_kbps` enforces a publisher ceiling with configurable spike tolerance (`max_input_bitrate_spike_tolerance`) and sustained violation timeout (`max_input_bitrate_violation_timeout`).
- Publishers that sustain violations past the timeout are disconnected.

**Audio gap filling**

- `audio_gap_fill` inserts silent AAC or Opus frames when audio PTS gaps are detected to prevent OBS audio breaking during packet loss. Stats endpoint reports audio gap counters. Iterated fixes for PES continuation handling and CC rewriting.

**HTTP stats and control API**

- New `/healthz` endpoint for Kubernetes probes.
- New disconnect stream endpoint with API key authorization.
- `api_keys` directive supports comma separated keys with constant time comparison.
- Atomic stats counters and a read locked `put()` so `/stats` no longer stalls the data path.
- Replaced the blocking HTTP client with an `AsyncHttpClient` (thread pool backed) for stats posting, player key validation, and `on_event_url` callbacks.
- New per stream `/stats` diagnostics for the jump/replay class of viewer issue: `maxReaderBacklogBytes` and `maxReaderBacklogMs` (furthest any viewer fell behind the ring write head, the size of a potential catch up burst) alongside the existing `ringOverruns`.
- Fixed `sendBackpressure`, which was read off the publisher role (which never runs the egress write path) and so was structurally always zero. It is now aggregated across a stream's viewers via the shared ring, so it reflects real viewer backpressure.
- Teardown log lines (`check_invalid_sock`, `get_state`) now carry `stream=<name>` for grep based correlation across many concurrent streams, and a flight recorder line at publisher teardown records the session's peak backlog, overruns, and viewer backpressure before the ring is freed (survives publisher reconnect).

**Logging redesign**

- Per category log levels (`log_level_connection`, `log_level_listener`, `log_level_stream`, `log_level_data`, `log_level_relay`, `log_level_http`, `log_level_auth`, `log_level_system`).
- Rate limited repetitive events (`log_rate_limit_*`).
- Periodic operational summary (`log_summary_*`).
- Session id tagging on log lines for grep based correlation (`log_session_ids`).
- Optional JSON file sink (`log_format json`) for log aggregators.

**Security and hardening**

- Listener wide SRT encryption via `srt_passphrase` and `srt_pbkeylen`, validated at listener start.
- Handshake time rejection for streamid based DoS (`auth_reject_cache_ttl` negative cache on the canonical streamid).
- Streamid sanitization: reject unsafe characters in host, app, and stream components; trim whitespace; reject URL significant characters.
- Bounded and time gated auth, rate limit, and player key caches.
- Constant time API key comparison on control endpoints.
- Drop privileges after binding via `user` and `group` directives.
- Numeric config values validated through `strtol` / `strtod`.
- Async signal safe signal handlers; SIGTERM handling.
- `peer_idle_timeout` (`SRTO_PEERIDLETIMEO`) per accepted socket.

**Stability and performance**

- Publisher takeover on reconnect.
- Event driven worker (`eventfd`, no polling `msleep` on Linux), portable `epoll` wakeup via self pipe on non Linux.
- Event driven egress, drop the permanent `SRT_EPOLL_OUT` arm.
- Player latency clamped via `SRTO_PEERLATENCY`; bumped UDP buffers; explicit `SRTO_TLPKTDROP`.
- Disconnect viewers stuck in continuous backpressure; handle `EASYNCSND` backpressure without disconnecting healthy viewers.
- Race free `m_nDataCount`, write locked `setSize` on the publisher ring; size publisher ring per bitrate with reader overrun detection.
- Egress tuned to stop live viewers replaying stale video. The publisher ring is sized at 1x the latency window instead of 2x, and `MAX_EGRESS_BATCHES` is reduced from 8 to 2, so a viewer that falls behind is skipped forward per packet by SRT `TLPKTDROP` at the socket rather than catching up in a large burst of old frames (which a viewer perceives as a jump back then skip forward). The ring is treated as a small hand off buffer, not a jitter buffer; the SRT socket holds each viewer's latency window.
- Compile out per packet `SPDLOG_TRACE` / `SPDLOG_DEBUG` on the data path; drop per packet string allocations.
- Race and leak fixes on the accept path (close socket and free `addrinfo` on `libsrt_setup` errors; stop leaking `stat_info_t` per accepted role; null check `strdup(sid)`; kick publisher via atomic flag in `disconnect_stream`).
- Removed HLS recording.

**Portability**

- Build restored on macOS (portable `pthread_t` formatting, portable link libs, qualified `socket::bind`).

**Tooling**

- doctest based unit test harness wired into CTest; first tests covering `SLSRecycleArray`, `auth_reject_cache`, `sls_sid`, bitrate limit, and audio gap filler. AddressSanitizer / UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer and ThreadSanitizer build options. GitHub Actions matrix building Release plus the two sanitizer flavors and running `ctest`.
- `clang-format` and `clang-tidy` configs; `-Wextra -Wshadow` warnings enabled.
- Pinned vendored submodules (cpp-httplib `v0.48.0`, json `v3.12.0`, spdlog tracks the `irlserver/spdlog` fork). SRT belabox fork pinned by commit in the Dockerfile.

**IP-ACL**

- IPv6 peers no longer silently bypass IPv4 allow / deny rules. They are matched only against the wildcard entry and otherwise hit the documented default with a one shot warning per call. Specific IPv6 ACL entries are still not supported (see `CONFIGURATION.md`).

### v3.0.0

- Switched to git submodules for vendored libraries (`spdlog`, `cpp-httplib`, `nlohmann/json`, `thread-pool`, `CxxUrl`).

### v2.5.0

- Per stream player limit (`max_players_per_stream`) with per session override returned by the player key validation API.
- Initial player key validation against an external API endpoint.
- Initial bitrate limiting feature for SRT stream input with configurable violation timeout.
- Disconnect stream endpoint, gated by API key authorization.
- SIGTERM signal handling.
- Refactored `SLSListener` into modular components (`SLSListenerCore`, `SLSListenerAuth`, `SLSListenerConfig`, `SLSListenerHandler`).
- Separate publisher and player listen ports (`listen_publisher`, `listen_player`).
- Dynamic latency, additional listener and worker logging, configuration file search in standard paths.

### v2.4.1

- API key support for control endpoints.

### v2.4.0

- Enabled `SRTO_SRTLAPATCHES` for SRTLA / bonded cellular compatibility.

### v2.3.2

- Stats: always emit the publishers array when status is ok; initialize the SRT stats object before requesting stats.

### v2.3.1

- Increased `POLLING_TIME` to reduce CPU usage.

### v2.3.0

- Switched the SRT dependency to the `irlserver/srt` fork (belabox patches).
- Lowered SRT flight credit constant.

### v2.2.0 (security update)

- Initial IPv6 support on listener sockets.
- SRT socket option tweaks.
- Small JSON API fixes; lower `TS_UDP_LEN` log severity to trace.
