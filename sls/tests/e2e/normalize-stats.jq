# Reduce a /stats (or control) JSON response to its STRUCTURAL SHAPE only, so a
# committed golden snapshot locks the SET and NESTING of keys without pinning any
# volatile runtime value. This is the lock for the "must not change the
# stats/control API shape" constraint (todo 37): adding, removing, or renaming a
# key changes this output; changing a counter/rate/timestamp does NOT.
#
# Redactions, and WHY each redacted field is volatile (must not be asserted):
#   number  -> "<number>" : every counter/rate/gauge is run-dependent —
#       pktRcvLoss, pktRcvDrop, bytesRcvLoss, bytesRcvDrop, mbpsRecvRate, rtt,
#       msRcvBuf, mbpsBandwidth, bitrate, uptime, latency, ringOverruns,
#       sendBackpressure, the audioGapFill gap/byte/frame counters, and each
#       track's pid/streamType/streamId/sampleRate/channels/lastGap* values.
#   boolean -> "<bool>"   : enabled / pmtParsed / formatDetected depend on
#       config and PMT timing, so only their PRESENCE is part of the contract.
#   string  -> "<string>" : status text and any string value is content, not
#       shape.
#   dynamic publisher map key (the live stream id, e.g. "publish/live/abc123")
#       -> collapsed to ONE representative entry under the fixed key
#       "<STREAM_ID>", so the snapshot never depends on the stream name and a
#       single live publisher is enough to lock the per-publisher object.
#   arrays  -> at most ONE normalized element, so the element shape is locked
#       without depending on the live element count (audioGapFill.tracks[]).
# Object KEYS are preserved verbatim: they ARE the shape under test.
