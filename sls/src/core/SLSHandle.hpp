// Small, move-only RAII owners for the two libsrt resources whose lifetime SLS
// manages by hand: the SRT epoll id and the SRT listen socket. Each releases its
// resource on destruction, so an early return / exception between acquisition and
// the point where ownership is handed to a long-lived member cannot leak the fd.
// Both are deliberately thin wrappers around the same srt_* primitives the code
// already calls (srt_epoll_create/release, srt_create_socket/srt_close) — they
// change *who closes the fd and when*, never the fd value itself, so the values
// exposed via CSLSSrt::libsrt_get_fd / libsrt_set_fd and the epoll arming logic
// are untouched. release() relinquishes ownership (the value survives into the
// member); reset() adopts a fresh value, releasing any previously held one.

// Owns an SRT epoll id (srt_epoll_create -> srt_epoll_release). The invalid
// sentinel is -1, matching srt_epoll_create's <0 failure return, so a
// default-constructed or moved-from handle releases nothing.
