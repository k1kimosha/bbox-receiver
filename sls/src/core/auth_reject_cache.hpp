// Process-wide negative cache of publisher streamids that recently failed
// webhook authorization. The listener thread reads it inside the SRT
// handshake callback (is_blocked), and worker threads write it on auth
// failure (record_failure). This turns a streamid-rotating attacker's
// repeat attempts on the same bad key into cheap handshake rejections
// instead of a full accept plus on_event_url webhook lookup each time.
//
// One instance is owned by CSLSManager and injected into the publisher
// listeners and the roles they create (dependency injection, no global
// singleton). Stored as a shared_ptr by every holder so the cache outlives
// any listener socket whose handshake callback still references it.
